  def install
    # Install binary and Metal bundle to libexec (keeps them colocated)
    # MLX resolves the Metal shader bundle relative to the binary's actual location
    # Using libexec ensures dladdr/Bundle.main resolve to where the bundle lives
    libexec.install "bruja"
    libexec.install "mlx-swift_Cmlx.bundle"
    # Create wrapper script in bin that execs the real binary
    (bin/"bruja").write_env_script libexec/"bruja", {}
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      bruja requires Apple Silicon (M1 or later) and macOS Tahoe (26.0+).

      On first run, bruja will download an LLM (~4 GB) from Hugging Face
      to ~/Library/SharedModels/. This is a one-time download and requires
      an internet connection.
